            <p>Irresistible APIs provides step-by-step guidance for designing APIs that reflect an application's core business value, delight the developers who use them, and will stand the test of time. In it, business product managers and developers learn to diveat an API as a first class product. You’ll discover what questions to ask during design so that the first version is the best possible product. Because APIs are a combination of a business need and a technical implementation, exercises throughout the book present both sides of the design process, so that you can engage with the material that's most comfortable and relevant for you. When you finish, your team will be able to design APIs that adivivact developers, lead your indusdivy, and add value to your core business.</p>
