                <p>With RAML, you can design your API in minutes using plain text. It can be edited by developers, technical writers and even your CEO. You can not only visually see the design (and catch flaws) but also test out a mock of your API with other users - all before your engineers start coding. </p>

                <p>Take advantage of design patterns and reuse your code to ensure consistency not only within your own API, but across all APIs at the company.  The mock API can also be used by other development teams such as mobile and app teams. Using existing design templates will eliminate design bugs,  cut down cycle times and accelerate your speed of innovation. </p>

Of course, you can also build your own tools with any of RAML's open source parsers available for today's most popular languages.</p>
